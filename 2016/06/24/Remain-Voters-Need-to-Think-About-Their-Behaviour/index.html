I actually voted remain as I believe that was the correct decision, but clearly most people thought differently. If you are asking, why would someone who voted remain be writing about the behaviour of remain voters? The answer is simple, I like to think of myself as an open minded, see the benefits in anything, kind of person. It seems like there have been many ignorant (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ignorant">definition</a> for those that are unaware) and offensive remain voters today, just because they were out voted. I know many, many people who voted out, not because it was the safe thing, not because it was the easy choice, but because they <em>believed</em> it was the best in the <em>long</em> term. I <em>believe</em> we would be better in, enjoying the benefits of the European Union until it collapses (which it will no matter what happens over the next few months).</p>

<h2 id="Another-Referendum-Petition"><a href="#Another-Referendum-Petition" class="headerlink" title="Another Referendum Petition"></a>Another Referendum Petition</h2><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/brexit-petition-for-second-eu-referendum-so-popular-the-government-sites-crashing-a7099996.html">petition</a> was so popular that it actually brought down the petition site! I’m not saying that we shouldn’t create petitions for things we believe in, after all, I have signed many and many have been successful. However, it smacks me in the face of a bunch of toddlers throwing their toys out of their push chair because other people have a different view. This is the first time that I can remember that more people have voted for the same thing than not. For example, in the last general election, 36.9% voted for the Conservatives, meaning that 63.1% did <strong>NOT</strong> want the Conservatives. However, in this referendum, 51.9% voted to leave and only 48.1% voted to remain.</p>
<h2 id="Immigration-Control-is-Bad"><a href="#Immigration-Control-is-Bad" class="headerlink" title="Immigration Control is Bad"></a>Immigration Control is Bad</h2><p>This is a very controversial topic with the remain voters. Controlled immigration is not bad at all, it is actually good for everyone. From Britain’s point of view, we only get the skilled workers that we need (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) and not the people we already have the skills for. It also means we can try and break down our 7% unemployment level. From other countries’ point of view, they only lose some of their skilled workers, not all of them. This means that they still have an economy and are not devastated because supposedly “better” countries get all of the good workers (which is what Germany and other larger economy countries are doing).</p>
<h2 id="The-European-is-NOT-Democratic"><a href="#The-European-is-NOT-Democratic" class="headerlink" title="The European is NOT Democratic"></a>The European is NOT Democratic</h2><p>It clearly is <strong>NOT</strong> a democratic system and not in the way the ‘Vote Leave’ campaigners were saying. Certain countries in the European Union have more of a say than others. Not only that, at the last European elections, the average UK citizen was 1 vote in 875,000 votes for 1 MEP, who was in turn 1 MEP in 751 MEPs. In the last general election, the average UK citizen was 1 vote in 10,000 votes for 1 MP, who was in turn 1 MP in 650. How is this a democracy we want to be part of, where people’s voices are worth less and are even biased?</p>
<h2 id="Economic-Changes"><a href="#Economic-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Economic Changes"></a>Economic Changes</h2><p>Then there is the fact that the European Union economies are actually shrinking, so being stuck with them is not beneficial, it’s a hindrance. Whilst part of the European Union, countries are not able to negotiate their own trade agreements with other countries. This means that the UK were unable to have trade agreements with growing economies such as China, India and Brazil.</p>
<h2 id="Leave-Voters-are"><a href="#Leave-Voters-are" class="headerlink" title="Leave Voters are "></a>Leave Voters are <enter rude word></h2><p>This is what really drives me mad. There are plenty of remain voters who have <em>no idea</em> what the benefits are of being out of the European Union. Please, do some research on what the benefits are instead of only what the bad things are. Next time you disagree with someone, think, do they actually make sense? Am I actually in the wrong? Just because Nigel Farage is a mad man, doesn’t mean <em>ALL</em> people who are voting the same way are.</p>
<h2 id="Blaming-People"><a href="#Blaming-People" class="headerlink" title="Blaming People"></a>Blaming People</h2><p>I have seen too many people complaining about the older generations voting to leave and “ruining” this country. However, let’s look at the facts about this. The areas with a younger voting population had a lower turn out. Also, only 67.2% of people in Scotland and 62.9% in Northern Ireland turned up to vote, so the fact they are both upset wanting independent referendums is a joke. If they genuinely cared, they would have voted to remain. We can only look at ourselves for what has happened. Did we campaign enough, did we explain to each other what really are the issues with either leave or remain? I think we got so caught up in <em>both</em> sides scare mongering and mud slinging, that we never stopped to help each other out.</p>
<p>As a final note, I was terrified this morning when I saw that the UK had voted to leave the European Union, thinking the economy was going to take a nose dive. No surprise that it did, but it’s recovered to higher than it was at the start of the week. To put it into perspective with the rest of the world’s markets, the FTSE100 (UK) fell 3.15%, the DAX (Germany) fell 6.82%, the Cac40 (France) fell 8.04%, the Dow Jones (US) fell 3.18% and the Nikkei225 (Japan) fell 7.92%. So really, we didn’t do too badly on that front. But we are where we are and we have to take things forward. Make Britain a shining beacon of love, harmony and communication, where people of all ages and from all over the world can come, work, enjoy and support each other. So please, less hate for those that happen to disagree with you and more co-operation in making things better for all.</p>
