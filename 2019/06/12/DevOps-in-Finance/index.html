Before joining, I heard a lot of the horror stories of the “requirement” to stay until 10 at night and never being able to use any of the latest tools, but I can categorically state, that is wrong. Or at least it is wrong for me. However, that doesn’t mean what I have learnt is good either. What I have learnt is that finance needs, ironically, investment. Yes, they have some amazing tools for their time and I really do mean that. The problem is their lack of forethought around the 2008 financial crisis, whereby whole teams were let go and systems were left to die. This is now leading to a massive surge of “DevOps” within all of the financial firms.</p>

<h2 id="What-do-they-mean-by-DevOps"><a href="#What-do-they-mean-by-DevOps" class="headerlink" title="What do they mean by DevOps?"></a>What do they mean by DevOps?</h2><p>As anyone who has been “doing DevOps” will know, it is a very nondescript term. Yes, it is always categorised as development + operations, but it is so broad that it never really boils down to anything tangible. But in the banks, there is a distinct feel that to the people leading it, it’s a buzz word that they need to add to their repertoire, otherwise they won’t be able to hire anyone. Do they understand DevOps? No. Do they understand the benefits? Yes. They know it will give them cost savings, higher efficiencies and happier employees and that’s what they will get.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-they-doing-to-get-there"><a href="#What-are-they-doing-to-get-there" class="headerlink" title="What are they doing to get there?"></a>What are they doing to get there?</h2><p>On Monday, I went to the Credit Suisse DevOps Expo in London, hosted in their shiny office building in Canary Wharf, where in all honesty, I learnt next to nothing. Not to say the talks were boring or that they weren’t correct, just I’d heard it all before. Also, they had some good speakers there. I think Martin Woodward from Microsoft DevOps is a fantastic speaker and what they are doing in Microsoft is fantastic, but I’d heard his presentation only a few months ago. But this is a good sign, this means that what these banks are doing is bringing in the right people, talking about the right stuff. So obviously, the training is good!</p>
<p>Secondly, internally (as I do not work at Credit Suisse), we are having our own training sessions and the idea of DevOps is being pushed upon us along with other closely related ideas, such as Agile. This is slowly allowing for some actual innovation and ultimately some actual change and improvements, rather than the usual bolting on terrible “temporary” hacks which are still going to be there in production 10 years later.</p>
<p>Finally, they are providing nice new offices where we aren’t being packed in like chickens in a battery farm, whereby I literally mean that you had enough space for a keyboard and 2 monitors where your colleague’s monitors on either side were almost touching yours. They are trying to separate us from the usual requirements of dressing up as if we are talking to clients, when everyone knows that is never the case, and in my opinion, most clients would probably like to see the tech people in charge of their investments and money as being tech people, not business people.</p>
<p>All in all, do I believe that the finance industry is going in the right direction? Yes, not by choice or by will, but by necessity for their outlooks are bleak without these changes. However, my real concern is that they are going too slowly. There is too much resistance to change, too much middle management and oddly created roles such as “SMEs” (subject matter experts) and “proxy product owners” purely for the benefit of not addressing the issues of career development in technology and how that would relate to bonuses. These firms have so much money that it will take a while for them to fail, but they will unless they address the real issues. </p>
